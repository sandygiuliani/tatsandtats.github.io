### So what do I need to do in short?   
Book flights/trains and some place to sleep in Ravenna. Be in front of the Town Hall by 10.15 am on Saturday the 5th. Don't worry about getting to/from the reception - we got you covered. Dance. Cry tears of joy. Have fun. 

### How to get there?  
For those of you coming from abroad: nearest airport is Bologna (BLQ) airport. Bologna airport and station are connected by the [Aerobus bus](https://aerobus.bo.it/en) - no need to book this in advance. Direct regional ('Regionale') trains run once an hour between Bologna and Ravenna, check the [Trenitalia website](http://www.trenitalia.com/tcom-en) for train times - Bologna station is called 'Bologna Centrale'. Again, no need to book this in advance, but you can buy your tickets online or on the Trenitalia app and show the barcode. Fast trains take 59 minutes and cost the same as the slow ones. Another option is this [shuttle bus](http://www.shuttlecrab.it/index_en.php) that runs 4 times a day between Bologna airport and Ravenna railway station. If you are flying into a different airport, you can catch a high speed train with [Trenitalia](http://www.trenitalia.com/tcom-en) or [Italo](https://www.italotreno.it/en) -best to book these in advance. 

The Town Hall is a 10-minute walk from Ravenna railway station. Transport will be provided from the ceremony to the reception venue and back. Parking space is limited at the reception venue, please let us know in advance if you would prefer to drive there with your own car. If you are driving around in Ravenna, please familiarise yourself with the area of Ravenna that is closed to the traffic ([ZTL](http://www.turismo.ra.it/eng/Travel/Getting-around/Limited-traffic-zones-(ZTL))). Free parking in Ravenna can be found [next to the Rocca Brancaleone](https://goo.gl/maps/ap1VQKKn2M32). For any eventuality, we recommend saving the number for Ravenna Taxis: 0039054433888 (most operators will speak English).

### Where to stay?   
We recommend these two hotels in Ravenna: [NH Hotel](https://www.nh-hotels.com/hotel/nh-ravenna) and [Hotel Diana](http://www.hoteldiana.ra.it/). Re NH Hotel, the rooms we had reserved have now been released, so you may still consider booking there but there is no special offer. For Hotel Diana, ask a quote directly to them via email at hdianaravenna@gmail.com and mention our surnames to get the best deal. If you choose to stay elsewhere, bear in mind most of Ravenna town centre is closed to traffic - we recommend staying within walking distance to the Town Hall. Another option is [AirBnb](https://www.airbnb.com/).    

### What to wear?   
Anything you wish to wear we are sure it will be ok - if in doubt, go semi-formal. Kilts & traditional outfits are very welcome. Do bear in mind that the reception is partly on grass (and there will be dancing!) so choose your footwear wisely.    

### What to bring?
There is nothing we need other than you coming to share the day with us. Your presence is enough of a present! For this reason there is no registry but we did set up a charity fundraising page instead, which you are welcome to contribute towards, find the link below:
